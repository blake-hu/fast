Team Members: Blake Hu, Julian Baldwin, Marko Veljanovski, Michelle Zhang, Sophia Pi, Stephen Cheng

## FAST: Feedforward-Augmented Sentence Transformers
Generalizing sentence embeddings to a wide range of natural language tasks using feedforward neural networks, with massive speedup on fine-tuning. Inspired by DoubleLingo.

### Setup
```
cd fast
conda create -y --name fast python==3.9
